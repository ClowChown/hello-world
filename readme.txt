I really enjoyed the film “Tampopo”! I watched it two days ago and I gave it a 5/5. The film celebrates how humans enjoy food — whether it be in a sexual, intimate, survival, or artistic manner. Little vignettes featuring hilariously eccentric to heartbreakingly warm characters are sprinkled throughout the film. Though these side-stories pan away from the main Tampopo storyline, they parallel how important extra "flavors" are to a masterfully constructed ramen dish. The film's unique structure, just like the process of creating the perfect ramen dish, is a culmination of artistic excellence and life's full flavors.
